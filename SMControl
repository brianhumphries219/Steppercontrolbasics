/*
Written for Arduino to do basic stepper motor controls via manual input. (button or keypress?)

Basic structure idea (eventuality, small modules/basic shit to start)
-looks to a config file for user-alterable variables per motor (enable/disable, movement ratio from steps, rpm, acceleration, max steps)
-Can control up to 5 motors
-can use a controller to move motors (like an xbox controller/strung together with parts); or jogwheel, joystick, etc
-counts steps and displays to computer/console for each motor
-waypoint system: "set" function once at a location. Can have multiple waypoints, go to command.
